# Message Boundary Event

A boundary event attached to an activity that triggers when a specific named message is received while the activity is active.

## Key characteristics

- Attached to an activity; has no incoming flow and one outgoing flow.
- The message is matched by name and can carry payload variables into the process.
- **Interrupting:** The attached activity is cancelled and the token moves to the boundary event's outgoing flow.
- **Non-interrupting:** The attached activity continues and a new token is created on the boundary event's outgoing flow.

## Graphical notation

A circle on the activity border with an envelope icon. Solid border = interrupting; dashed border = non-interrupting.

<div style={{"display": "flex", "gap": "24px", "alignItems": "flex-start"}}>
