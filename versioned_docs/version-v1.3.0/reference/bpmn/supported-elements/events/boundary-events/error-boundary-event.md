# Error Boundary Event

A boundary event that triggers when a matching BPMN error is raised inside the activity it is attached to.

## Key characteristics

- Attached to an activity; has no incoming flow and one outgoing flow.
- Matches a thrown error by `errorCode`.
- Matching walks up the scope hierarchy; an unhandled error becomes an incident.
- Always interrupting — cancels the host activity when triggered.

## Supported activity types

Service task, User task, Business Rule task, Script task, Call activity.

## Graphical notation

A solid double-line circle on the activity border with a lightning-bolt icon.
