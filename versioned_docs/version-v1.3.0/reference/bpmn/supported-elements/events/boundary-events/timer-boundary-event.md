# Timer Boundary Event

A boundary event attached to an activity that fires when a specified time condition is met while the activity is active.

## Key characteristics

- Attached to an activity; has no incoming flow and one outgoing flow.
- **Interrupting:** The attached activity is cancelled and the token moves to the boundary event's outgoing flow.
- **Non-interrupting:** The attached activity continues and a parallel token is created on the boundary event's outgoing flow (e.g. for sending reminders).
- Supports three timer types: duration, date, and cycle.

## Graphical notation

A circle on the activity border with a clock icon. Solid border = interrupting; dashed border = non-interrupting.
