# Link Intermediate Catch Event

The receiving side of a link pair — matched to its throw counterpart by name. Used to connect two points in a diagram without drawing a sequence flow between them.

## Key characteristics

- Has one outgoing sequence flow; no incoming flow.
- Resumes the flow where the matching Link Throw Event left off.
- Matched by link name within the same process.
- Commonly used as an "off-page connector" to keep large diagrams readable.

## Graphical notation

A double-line circle with an unfilled arrow icon.
