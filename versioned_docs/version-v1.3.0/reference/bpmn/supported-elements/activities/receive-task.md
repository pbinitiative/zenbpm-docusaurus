# Receive task

A Receive Task pauses the process and waits until a specific named message is received, then continues execution.

## Key characteristics

- One incoming and one outgoing sequence flow.
- Blocks the token until the matching message arrives.
- Functionally equivalent to a Message Intermediate Catch Event, but modelled as a task.

## Graphical notation
