# Send task

A Send Task sends a defined message and then immediately continues execution without waiting for a response.

## Key characteristics

- One incoming and one outgoing sequence flow.
- Sends the message and moves on — does not block the token.
- Functionally equivalent to a Message Intermediate Throw Event, but modelled as a task.

## Graphical notation

  <bpmn:outgoing>Flow_2</bpmn:outgoing>
</bpmn:sendTask>

<bpmn:message id="Message_1" name="OrderConfirmation" />
```
