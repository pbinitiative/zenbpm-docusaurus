# Conditional flow

A Conditional Flow is a sequence flow with an attached condition expression. It is evaluated by an Exclusive or Inclusive gateway to determine whether the flow is taken.

## Key characteristics

- Carries a condition expression that evaluates to `true` or `false`.
- Used on outgoing flows of Exclusive and Inclusive gateways.
- If the condition is true, the token follows this flow.
