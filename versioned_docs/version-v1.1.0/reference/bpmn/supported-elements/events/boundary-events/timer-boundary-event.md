# Timer Boundary Event

A Timer Boundary Event is attached to the boundary of an activity and fires when a specified time condition is met while the activity is active.

## Key characteristics

- **Time-based trigger:** The event fires after a duration, at a specific date/time, or on a repeating cycle while the activity is waiting.
- **Interrupting vs. non-interrupting:**
  - **Interrupting:** The attached activity is cancelled and the token moves to the boundary event's outgoing flow.
  - **Non-interrupting:** The attached activity continues and a parallel token is created on the boundary event's outgoing flow (e.g. for sending reminders).
- **Timer types supported:**
  - **Duration:** Fires after the activity has been active for the specified duration.
  - **Date:** Fires at a specific point in time.
  - **Cycle:** Fires repeatedly at a defined interval.
