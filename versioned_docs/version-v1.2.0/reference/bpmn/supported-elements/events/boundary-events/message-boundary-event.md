# Message Boundary Event

A Message Boundary Event is attached to the boundary of an activity and is triggered when a specific named message is received while the activity is active.

## Key characteristics

- **Message-driven interruption:** When the defined message arrives, the boundary event fires and the flow continues along the boundary event's outgoing sequence flow.
- **Interrupting vs. non-interrupting:**
  - **Interrupting:** The attached activity is cancelled and the token moves to the boundary event's outgoing flow.
  - **Non-interrupting:** The attached activity continues executing and a new token is created on the boundary event's outgoing flow.
- **Message correlation:** The message is matched by name and can carry payload variables into the process.
