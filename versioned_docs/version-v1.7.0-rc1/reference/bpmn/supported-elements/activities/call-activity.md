# Call activity

A Call Activity invokes another, independently deployed process. It lets several processes reuse the same process logic and keeps large models decomposed into separately deployed and versioned pieces. In ZenBPM the called process runs as its own process instance linked to the parent on the same [partition](../../../cluster.md); the parent token waits at the Call Activity until the called instance completes.

## Use cases

- **Reuse shared logic** — call one deployed process, such as customer verification, from several different parent processes.
- **Decompose large processes** — split a complex model into separately deployed processes with independent lifecycles.
- **Process collections** — combine with the [multi-instance marker](./activity-multi-instance.md) to start one called instance per element, for example one delivery process per shipment.

## Usage in BPMN

Reference the process to call in a `zenbpm:calledElement` extension element. Optionally, control the data that flows into and out of the called instance with a `zenbpm:ioMapping`.

| Extension element                    | Attribute          | Required | Description                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `zenbpm:calledElement`               | `processId`        | yes      | Id of the deployed process to start. Only a direct, static id is supported — expressions are not evaluated — and the latest deployed version is always used. |
| `zenbpm:ioMapping` → `zenbpm:input`  | `source`, `target` | no       | Initializes variables of the called instance. See [Variables](../../variable-mapping.md).                                                     |
| `zenbpm:ioMapping` → `zenbpm:output` | `source`, `target` | no       | Maps variables of the completed called instance back to the process scope. See [Variables](../../variable-mapping.md).                        |

Execution flow:

1. A token arrives at the Call Activity, input mappings are evaluated, and the engine resolves the latest deployed process definition with the configured `processId` — if none is deployed, the activity fails.
2. A new instance of the called process is created, linked to the parent and running on the same partition. It starts with a snapshot copy of the parent's variables plus the input-mapped values; changes inside the called instance do not write back to the parent. The parent token waits, and boundary events attached to the Call Activity are armed.
3. The called instance executes like any other process instance.
4. On completion, **only output-mapped variables are propagated to the parent scope**, and the parent token continues.
5. An error end event in the called process bubbles up to the parent and can be caught by an [error boundary event](../events/error-events.md#error-boundary-event) on the Call Activity — including across nested Call Activities. An uncaught error creates an incident.

## XML example

A Call Activity that starts the latest deployed version of the `customer-verification` process. The input mapping passes the customer id into the called instance; the output mapping stores the verification result in the parent process variable `customerVerified`:

```xml
<bpmn:callActivity id="Activity_VerifyCustomer" name="Verify customer">
  <bpmn:extensionElements>
    <zenbpm:calledElement processId="customer-verification" />
    <zenbpm:ioMapping>
      <zenbpm:input source="=order.customerId" target="customerId" />
      <zenbpm:output source="=verificationResult" target="customerVerified" />
    </zenbpm:ioMapping>
  </bpmn:extensionElements>
  <bpmn:incoming>Flow_In</bpmn:incoming>
  <bpmn:outgoing>Flow_Out</bpmn:outgoing>
</bpmn:callActivity>
```
