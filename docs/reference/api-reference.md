# API Overview

ZenBPM provides comprehensive APIs for interacting with the BPMN engine. This section documents the available APIs and how to use them.

## Available APIs

ZenBPM offers two primary API interfaces:

- **REST API**: HTTP-based API for web applications and general integration
- **gRPC API**: High-performance RPC framework for system-to-system communication

## REST API

The REST API follows standard RESTful principles

- See the [OpenAPI specification](../../openapi/redocusaurus/api.yaml)
- See the [OpenApi documentation](/openapi-api)

## gRPC API

The gRPC API provides similar functionality to the REST API but with the performance benefits of gRPC. It's defined using Protocol Buffers.

- See the [Protocol Buffer definitions ](../../proto/zenbpm.proto)
